# February-2015-US-Airline-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

We will focus on the sentiment analysis of the tweets about the six major U.S. airlines. The data was
scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as “late flight” or “rude service”). Through the exploratory analysis and sentiment analysis process, we were able to understand the key features of the positive and negative tweets about the six major U.S. airlines, and revealed some interesting findings. We then applied the classification algorithms learned in class to categorize sentiments by analyzing texts and compared the prediction performance among all these methods by looking at accuracy.
